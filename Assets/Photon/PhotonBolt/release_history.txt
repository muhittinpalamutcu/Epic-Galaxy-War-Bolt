1.2.10

Added: Public API for Connection Packet count metrics: Sent, Received and Lost.
Added: BoltConnection has now a "ConnectionType" field, that signals when the connection is Direct or Relayed.
Added: New API call to force sync scenes between client and server (BoltNetwork.LoadSceneSync()). Useful if the "Auto Scene Load" is disabled.
Added: Search Path feature to Bolt Assets. Now you can select the desired locations where Bolt will search for Entity Prefabs.
Added: Sample "A2S Protocol Service".
Added: Sample "Area Of Interest".

Fixed: When switching control over an entity (using AssignControl) several times causes an entity freeze with a full input queue. Now, it will only execute for different connection other than the current one.
Fixed: Manually removing from scope an entity from its controller succeeds on the server and causes the client to error. By default, the scope can only be set to other connections different from the controller.
Fixed: Current Session/Room Player count.
Fixed: High CPU usage when running a Headless server with NAT PunchThrough disabled.
Fixed: UdpPlatform double initialization. Starting Bolt multiple times will not cause a duplicated instantiation of the active Platform.

Changed: Skip button on Photon Cloud configuration inside the Bolt Wizard window for Bolt Pro version.
Changed: Public API Naming of BoltEntity. Several methods and functions were refactored to agree with the C# Coding Guidelines. The old symbols are still present, but with an obsolete marking and will be removed in a future version.
Changed: "SessionListUpdated" callback is not called when running as Bolt Server.
Changed: "SessionListUpdated" is always called, even if there is not session available.

Fixed: JoinRoomTimeout issue. After the specified timeout, if the peer is not able to connect/join a room, the "SessionConnectFailed" callback will be raised.
Fixed: Bolt Wizard window menu item disappear when Updating Bolt if there are any errors on the scripts.
Fixed: No callback when the client attempts to connect to a full server or to a closed room. When the target room is full, you will receive a "SessionConnectFailed" callback.
Fixed: Wrong callback called when the max CCU limit is reached. When this occurs, the peer will receive a "BoltShutdownBegin" with the "UdpConnectionDisconnectReason.MaxCCUReached" as "disconnectReason".
Fixed: Wrong callback called when the connection is refused. When the server refuses the connection, the "ConnectRefused" callback will be raised.
Fixed: Server authoritative movement in Bolt hackable. It was added the option "Enable Frame Limit" to all commands, that limit the queue/execution to only one command per frame (on client and server).
Fixed: "SessionListUpdated" not called anymore after connection attempt is refused.
Fixed: Issues with "InvalidRegion" after latest update of Photon Realtime.
Fixed: Latency simulation only works from client to server. Now it works as expected on both ends of the connection.

Added: New "GlobalEventListener.ShutdownBegin" with an extra parameter describing the Shutdown reason.
Added: New Bolt Setting to disable remote scene autoloading. By default, when the Bolt Host changes scenes, all clients will load the same scene, now you can disable this behavior.
Changed: Prompt developers to run the Bolt Compile Assembly after finishing the Wizard, this prevents errors when importing the samples package.
Changed: Bolt Menu Items are now merged. The access point to Bolt Settings, Assets and other windows are now inside a "Bolt" menu on the top-level of the toolbar.
